## 1. Fetching APIs
Learned to fetch data from external APIs using the Fetch API, with the Where the ISS at API providing real-time ISS location data.

## 2. Data Formats
Explored handling data in JSON, CSV, and text formats, displaying information in various ways.

## 3. Leaflet.js Maps
Utilized Leaflet.js to create interactive maps, adding markers and updating positions based on latitude and longitude.

## 4. Error Handling
Implemented error-handling mechanisms to gracefully manage issues during API requests or data processing.

## 5. Periodic Updates
Utilized `setInterval` to regularly update ISS marker positions, providing real-time tracking.

## 6. Project Overview
The ISS Location Tracker is easy to use. Clone the repository, open `index.html`, and explore real-time data, including latitude, longitude, altitude, velocity, and more.

### Usage
1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/Raj-400BC/ISS-Location-Tracker.git`
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Explore ISS details. Customize HTML to add more data points or features.
